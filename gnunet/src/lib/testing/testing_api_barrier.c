/**
 * @file testing/barrier.c
 * @brief convenience API for writing testcases for GNUnet
 *        Many testcases need to start and stop a peer/service
 *        and this library is supposed to make that easier
 *        for TESTCASES.  Normal programs should always
 *        use functions from gnunet_{util,arm}_lib.h.  This API is
 *        ONLY for writing testcases (or internal use of the testbed).
