 * @brief main for gnunet-service-transport
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * TODO:
 * Implement next:
 * - review retransmission logic, right now there is no smartness there!
 *   => congestion control, etc [PERFORMANCE-BASICS]
 *
 * Optimizations-Statistics:
 * - Track ACK losses based on ACK-counter [ROUTING]
 * - Need to track total bandwidth per VirtualLink and adjust how frequently
 *   we send FC messages based on bandwidth-delay-product (and relation
 *   to the window size!). See OPTIMIZE-FC-BDP.
 * - Consider more statistics in #check_connection_quality() [FIXME-CONQ-STATISTICS]
 * - Adapt available_fc_window_size, using larger values for high-bandwidth
 *   and high-latency links *if* we have the RAM [GOODPUT / utilization / stalls]
 * - Set last_window_consum_limit promise properly based on
 *   latency and bandwidth of the respective connection [GOODPUT / utilization / stalls]
 *
 * Optimizations-DV:
 * - When forwarding DV learn messages, if a peer is reached that
 *   has a *bidirectional* link to the origin beyond 1st hop,
 *   do NOT forward it to peers _other_ than the origin, as
 *   there is clearly a better path directly from the origin to
 *   whatever else we could reach.
 * - When we passively learned DV (with unconfirmed freshness), we
 *   right now add the path to our list but with a zero path_valid_until
 *   time and only use it for unconfirmed routes.  However, we could consider
 *   triggering an explicit validation mechanism ourselves, specifically routing
 *   a challenge-response message over the path [ROUTING]
 * = if available, try to confirm unconfirmed DV paths when trying to establish
 *   virtual link for a `struct IncomingRequest`. (i.e. if DVH is
 *   unconfirmed, incoming requests cause us to try to validate a passively
 *   learned path (requires new message type!))
 *
 * Optimizations-Fragmentation:
 * - Fragments send over a reliable channel could do without the
 *   AcknowledgementUUIDP altogether, as they won't be acked! [BANDWIDTH]
 *   (-> have 2nd type of acknowledgment message; low priority, as we
 *       do not have an MTU-limited *reliable* communicator) [FIXME-FRAG-REL-UUID]
 * - if messages are below MTU, consider adding ACKs and other stuff
 *   to the same transmission to avoid tiny messages (requires planning at
 *   receiver, and additional MST-style demultiplex at receiver!) [PACKET COUNT]
 *
 * Optimizations-internals:
 * - queue_send_msg by API design has to make a copy
 *   of the payload, and route_message on top of that requires a malloc/free.
 *   Change design to approximate "zero" copy better... [CPU]
 * - could avoid copying body of message into each fragment and keep
 *   fragments as just pointers into the original message and only
 *   fully build fragments just before transmission (optimization, should
 *   reduce CPU and memory use) [CPU, MEMORY]

/**
 * Computes the number of neighbours we should forward a DVInit
 * message to given that it has so far taken @a hops_taken hops
 * though the network and that the number of neighbours we have
 * in total is @a neighbour_count, out of which @a eligible_count
 * are not yet on the path.
 *
 * NOTE: technically we might want to include NSE in the formula to
 * get a better grip on the overall network size. However, for now
 * using NSE here would create a dependency issue in the build system.
 * => Left for later, hardcoded to 50 for now.
 *
 * The goal of the formula is that we want to reach a total of LOG(NSE)
 * peers via DV (`target_total`).  We want the reach to be spread out
 * over various distances to the origin, with a bias towards shorter
 * distances.
 *
 * We make the strong assumption that the network topology looks
 * "similar" at other hops, in particular the @a neighbour_count
 * should be comparable at other hops.
 *
 * If the local neighbourhood is densely connected, we expect that @a
 * eligible_count is close to @a neighbour_count minus @a hops_taken
 * as a lot of the path is already known. In that case, we should
 * forward to few(er) peers to try to find a path out of the
 * neighbourhood. OTOH, if @a eligible_count is close to @a
 * neighbour_count, we should forward to many peers as we are either
 * still close to the origin (i.e.  @a hops_taken is small) or because
 * we managed to get beyond a local cluster.  We express this as
 * the `boost_factor` using the square of the fraction of eligible
 * neighbours (so if only 50% are eligible, we boost by 1/4, but if
 * 99% are eligible, the 'boost' will be almost 1).
 *
 * Second, the more hops we have taken, the larger the problem of an
 * exponential traffic explosion gets.  So we take the `target_total`,
 * and compute our degree such that at each distance d 2^{-d} peers
 * are selected (corrected by the `boost_factor`).
 *
 * @param hops_taken number of hops DVInit has travelled so far
 * @param neighbour_count number of neighbours we have in total
 * @param eligible_count number of neighbours we could in
 *        theory forward to
