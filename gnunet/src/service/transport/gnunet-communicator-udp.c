 * @brief Transport plugin using UDP.
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * TODO:
 * - consider imposing transmission limits in the absence
 *   of ACKs; or: maybe this should be done at TNG service level?
 *   (at least the receiver might want to enforce limits on
 *    KX/DH operations per sender in here) (#5552)
 * - overall, we should look more into flow control support
 *   (either in backchannel, or general solution in TNG service)
 * - handle addresses discovered from broadcasts (#5551)
 *   (think: what was the story again on address validation?
 *    where is the API for that!?!)
 * - support DNS names in BINDTO option (#5528)
 * - support NAT connection reversal method (#5529)
 * - support other UDP-specific NAT traversal methods (#)
